# Migration off of GitHub

There are many concerns with GitHub Copilot. The point of Copilot is to generate code for users, which means ignoring any and all repository
licencing and using all code uploaded to GitHub for training the Copilot AI. GitHub is proprietary, yet pretends to support Free & Open
Source Software. GitHub does not offer any self-hosted option, and it's entire codebse is private, along with Copilot being made for profit.
I will be moving all of my projects over to my self-hosted instance of Forgejo. I also have an account over on Codeberg if anything were to
require collaborators, as Forgejo is not under federation yet. Any project done here on GitHub will be exclusively forks, or contributing to
other user's repositories. Please go look at Forgejo for my own projects. You can read [this article](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) for more information on this topic.<br>

Just a side note to prove my point: Copilot read this very file and automatically generated both the commit name and description. I ***did not*** tell
Copilot to do such thing. It also did the same for the commit adding this note.
